    "description": "What is data science, why is it so popular, and why did the Harvard Business Review hail it as the “sexiest job of the 21st century”? In this non-technical course, you’ll be introduced to everything you were ever too afraid to ask about this fast-growing and exciting field, without needing to write a single line of code. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll learn about the different data scientist roles, foundational topics like A/B testing, time series analysis, and machine learning, and how data scientists extract knowledge and insights from real-world data. So don’t be put off by the buzzwords. Start learning, gain skills in this hugely in-demand field, and discover why data science is for everyone!",
