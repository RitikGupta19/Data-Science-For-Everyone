    "name": "Data Science for Everyone",
    "description": "What is data science, why is it so popular, and why did the Harvard Business Review hail it as the “sexiest job of the 21st century”? In this non-technical course, you’ll be introduced to everything you were ever too afraid to ask about this fast-growing and exciting field, without needing to write a single line of code. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll learn about the different data scientist roles, foundational topics like A/B testing, time series analysis, and machine learning, and how data scientists extract knowledge and insights from real-world data. So don’t be put off by the buzzwords. Start learning, gain skills in this hugely in-demand field, and discover why data science is for everyone!",

We'll learn about the different data sources you can draw from, what that data looks like, how to store the data once it's collected, and how a data pipeline can automate the process.",

        "name": "Preparation, Exploration, and Visualization",
        "description": "Data preparation is fundamental: data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. This chapter will show you how to diagnose problems in your data, deal with missing values and outliers. You will then learn about visualization, another essential tool to both explore your data and convey your findings.",
